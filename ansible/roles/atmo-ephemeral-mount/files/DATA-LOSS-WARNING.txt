This directory and its contents will be *destroyed* when your Atmosphere
allocation is exceeded, and when certain instance actions are performed (e.g.
when the instance is shelved).
Do not store the sole copy of any important work or data in this directory!
Only store files which are easily re-created or which are also stored elsewhere.
Failure to heed this warning may result in data loss and sadness.
